<h2>Well, hello. What can I do for you?</h2>
<p>I'm a freelance <strong>writer, editor, and digital content manager</strong> with over 15 years of experience crafting concise, effective copy for business communications, websites and email campaigns. I also write commentary and features for lifestyle magazines and websites. Past corporate communications and content management clients and employers have included EMC, Crain Communications, Meredith Corporation, and the American Hospital Association. I've also written for <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=syUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT53&lpg=PT53&dq=vibe+vixen+wine&source=bl&ots=UKh02JhDrd&sig=oTuwkK2GbQuWLZEtGOu1IltwEyc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ5prIvqfQAhUIeSYKHR7ZCDoQ6AEILjAE#v=onepage&q=vibe%20vixen%20wine&f=false">Vibe Vixen</a>, <a href="https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-news/nia-williams-on-new-realities/0f278fb0-2c13-4729-9478-b982649dfe28">WBEZ</a>, Second Glass, <a href="http://www.modernhealthcare.com/staff/nia-williams">Modern Healthcare</a> and other publications.</p>

<p>I've been everywhere (man), but I've called Chicago home for nearly a decade. I've got a quick wit and restless feet. I once went 9 whole months without stepping foot outside the city and almost went mad.  What else? Avid reader, champion bargain-shopper, maker of rich and elaborate <a href="index.html">soups</a>. </p>
